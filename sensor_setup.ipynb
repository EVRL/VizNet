    "## Overview of Project\n",
    "In this project, a Raspberry Pi is equipped with a temperature and humidity sensor for the purpose of identifying anomalies in an Internet network in which the device is a part of. This is an example of an IOT device that will soon become commonplace in society. This project involves setting up the Raspberry Pi as well as generating traffic to/from it and finally employing different visualization techniques to identify normal and anomalous traffic involving the device. The traffic involving the device is generated by connecting the device to a network and polling for temperature/humidity information from the web server that is set up on the device as well as via SSH requests.\n",
